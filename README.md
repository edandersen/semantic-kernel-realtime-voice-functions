# .NET Semantic Kernel with OpenAI Realtime voice

Demo repo showing how to record audio and send it to the OpenAI gpt4o-voice-preview model for a two way chat.

Contains some concepts from https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/926a59095b8b9a4a2f0b9cf616caf9a1045b360f/dotnet/samples/Demos/OpenAIRealtime but updated to allow repeating the conversation loop and actually playing the .wav file.
